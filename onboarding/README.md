Welcome to the Donovan Lab! Below are the steps to help you get started working with us:

If you are new employee to ASU - 
* Attend new employee orientation

Upon joining the lab - 
* Ask Dr. Donovan to invite you to join the lab google drive, lab google calendar, lab Slack, GDCS Slack, and github
* Write up a short bio, and send to Dr. Donovan with a photo and links to relevent sites to include on the lab website
* If you are in Tempe - contact Andrea Cottrell about getting access to our space in ISTB7, you will need to complete a set of online safetry trainings as part of this and you will need to get a Sun Card which is how your access to the building will be loaded.
