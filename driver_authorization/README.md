# ASU Driver Authorization

This document takes you through the process of obtaining ASU driver authorization, which is needed to drive rental cars for travel.

General information on the process and a link to the training module can be found [here](https://cfo.asu.edu/defensive-driving-training). 

### Driver Authorization Training

1. Before you can complete the ASU Authorized Driver Program, you first need to complete the EHS Authorized Driver Training module. To do this, go to this page [here](https://cfo.asu.edu/defensive-driving-training) and click on the 'Training access' tab all the way at the bottom. 

2. Follow the 'Career EDGE' link (also found [here](https://asu.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/cf857f28-f55a-4a44-8b5a-db59dd7f439a)), and you will be prompted to log in with your MyASU ID and password.

3. Follow the training instructions, and once the training is successfully completed you should see a green 'Completed' status indicator on the right side.
    
    **Note**: After completing the Authorized Driver Training, it may take up to 72 hours to reflect the completion date on your record.

### Rental Car Driver Authorization
Once you have completed the EHS Authorized Driver Training, you can start the driver authorization process through your MyASU home page.

3. Follow the steps in the portal:
    - **Driver Record Consent**: Click the 'I consent' bubble.
    - **Driver's License Information**: Input your driver's license information into the proper fields, and click 'Submit License Data'.
    - **Driver Training Data**: Toggle the 'I Understand' slider to 'Yes'.
    - **Employee Acknowledgement**: Toggle the 'I Understand' slider to 'Yes', and click 'View Status'. You can return to this page periodically to monitor the progress of your Authorized Driver status.

4. After you have completed the above steps, you should get an invitation email from HireRight Customer Support to complete the motor vehicle record (MVR) check. Scroll down and click the 'Start Motor Vehicle Record Verification' button, and enter all necessary information for the MVR check.

5. Once the MVR Verification has been submitted, you should get two different confirmation emails from HireRight. Save these in case there are any issues with getting your Driver Authorization completed.

You can check the status of your Driver Authorization [here](https://www.asu.edu/go/authorizeddriver) under the 'Employee Acknowledgement' tab. 
This should be a relatively quick process, but if your authorization hasn’t been updated in two weeks or so, you should follow up with ASU’s Insurance Services ([insuranceservices@exchange.asu.edu](insuranceservices@exchange.asu.edu)). They may need a Cost Center Number and Program Code to charge the MVR fee to - check with Mary for these!
