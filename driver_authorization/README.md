# ASU Driver Authorization

This document takes you through the process of obtaining ASU driver authorization, which is needed to drive rental cars for travel.

General information on the process and a link to the training module can be found [here](https://cfo.asu.edu/defensive-driving-training). 

### Driver Authorization Training

1. Before you can complete the ASU Authorized Driver Program, you first need to complete the EHS Authorized Driver Training module. To do this, go to this page [here](https://cfo.asu.edu/defensive-driving-training) and click on the 'Training access' tab at the bottom. 

2. Follow the 'Career EDGE' link (also found [here](https://asu.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/cf857f28-f55a-4a44-8b5a-db59dd7f439a)), and you will be prompted to log in with your MyASU ID and password. 

3. Follow the training instructions, and once the training is successfully completed, you should see a green 'Completed' status indicator on the right side.

    **Note**: After completing the Authorized Driver Training, it may take up to 72 hours to reflect the completed date on your record.

### Rental Car Driver Authorization
Once you have completed the EHS Authorized Driver Training, you can start the driver authorization process through your MyASU home page.

1. Log in to your MyASU and click on the 'Staff' tab at the top right, under your name.

2. In the 'My Employment' box, naviagte to the 'Travel' heading and click on the Rental Car Driver Authorization link (can also be found [here](https://www.asu.edu/go/authorizeddriver)). 

3. Follow the steps in the portal:
    - **Driver Record Consent**: Click the 'I consent'bubble.
    - **Driver's License Information**: Input your driver's license information into the proper fields, and click 'Submit License Data'.
    - **Driver Training Data**: Toggle the 'I Understand' slider to 'Yes'.
    - **Employee Acknowledgement**: Toggle the 'I Understand' slider to 'Yes', and click 'View Status'. You can return to this page periodically to monitor the progress of your Authorized Driver status.

4. After you have completed the above steps, you should get an invitation email from HireRight to complete the motor vehicle record (MVR) check. Scroll down and click the 'Start Motor Vehicle Record Verification' button. 



This should be a relatively quick process, but if your authorization hasn’t been updated in a month or so, you should follow up with ASU’s Insurance Services ([insuranceservices@exchange.asu.edu](insuranceservices@exchange.asu.edu)). They may ask you for a Cost Center Number and Program Code to charge the MVR fee to, which are the following:
- **Cost Center Number**: CC0639
- **Program Code**: PG13694
