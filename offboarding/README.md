# Offboarding

## Below are some of the steps to wrap up your time working with us:

### File backups and ownership transfer
* Make sure all code is well annotated, pushed to the Donovan Lab Git, and has a detailed README.md to accompany the files in each repository
* Transfer ownership of any user-owned files on the Donovan Lab Google Drive to Dr. Donovan
* ASU Dropbox....not totally sure what the plan is to backup these files for the lab

### ASU computer offloading and return 
* Unlink all accounts (Dropbox, Google Drive, AppleID, etc.)
* Delete all personal files after making sure everything is backed up elsewhere
* Remove any downloaded applications that are extraneous
* Do not wipe the computer! Installed software/programs will be very useful for the next user
* After completing a file backup and cleaning personal accounts and files off the computer, return your ASU computer and charger to Dr. Donovan

### Miscellaneous
* On your last day in the office, return office keys to Dr. Donovan
* If applicable, return HPU parking pass to Dr. Donovan
* Forward your ASU email to a personal email address
* If you need continued access to the Donovan Lab Google Drive to finish shared projects, talk to
Dr. Donovan about the possibility of becoming a Courtesy Affiliate for a period of time
