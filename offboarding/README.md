# Offboarding

## Below are some of the steps to wrap up your time working with us:

### File backups and ownership transfer
* Make sure all code is well annotated, pushed to the Donovan Lab Git, and has a detailed README.md to accompany the files in each repository
* [Transfer ownership](https://github.com/Donovan-Lab-at-ASU/Lab_Management/blob/main/offboarding/Google%20Drive%20File%20Ownership%20Transfer.md) of any user-owned files on the Donovan Lab Google Drive to Dr. Donovan
* ASU Dropbox....*SH note: not totally sure what the plan is to backup these files for the lab, will update*

### ASU computer offloading and return 
* Unlink all accounts (Dropbox, Google Drive, AppleID, etc.)
* Delete all personal files after making sure everything is backed up elsewhere
* Remove any extraneous downloaded applications
* *Do not wipe the computer!* Installed software/programs will be useful for the next user
* After completing a file backup and cleaning personal accounts and files off the computer, return your ASU computer and charger to Dr. Donovan

### Miscellaneous
* Return office keys and HPU parking pass (if applicable) to Dr. Donovan
* Make sure your desk space is thoroughly cleaned and all personal items removed
* Forward your ASU email to a personal email address  
  *SH note: not sure if we retain our ASU email address, so this may not be relevant? Or is a personal choice?*
* If you need continued access to the Donovan Lab Google Drive to finish shared projects, talk to
Dr. Donovan about the possibility of becoming a Courtesy Affiliate for a period of time
