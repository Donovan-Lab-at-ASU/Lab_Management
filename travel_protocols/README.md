# Travel Protocols

This document is to outline the process of planning, booking and completing any travel you take as part of the lab. 

ASU uses the Concur travel system, which you can login to [here](https://myasutrip.asu.edu/login) with your MyASU id and password. Additional resources from ASU regarding travel can be found [here](https://cfo.asu.edu/myasutrip). 

### Creating a Travel Request

1. Before you book any travel, you must first create a new travel request. You can do this by clicking on the Request button at the top of the Concur homepage, and then clicking the "+" button.

2. You will be asked to fill out the "header" of the request. For simplicity, create a name that includes your last name, the destination and the month. (dept, cost center, buisness type, prpupose)

3. The next step is to add estimated expenses to the request. You should add flights, hotels, food and any other ground transportation you might need (ie taxis or buses to the airport). You may not know exactly how much everything will cost at this point - as a general rule of thumb, enter the maximum you think you will spend. You can always spend less than you request.

### Hotel costs 

Use the Department of Defense maximum lodging per diem for the location you are traveling - you can find that on this website here. Multiply this rate by number of days you are staying in that location.

### Flight costs

All ASU travel must be booked through Concur. Therefore, to get an estimate of your flights, use the travel tab to input your planned departure dates and cities. Take a look at the options to get an idea of how much it will cost and input this into your flight estimate.

Capello" - start typing Capello in the search bar and it should appear as an option.
